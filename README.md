### Overview

JAMM is Just A Music Maintainer!

It is meant to modify, manipulate, and maintain your Spotify playlists and library in ways that are currently not supported natively by Spotify.

At the moment, it is meant primarily to introduce "smart playlist" functionality similar to iTunes within Spotify.

### Inspiration

JAMM was inspired by many applications like it, but in particular [PLYLST](https://plylst.app/) which has recently been taken offline.

Although PLYLST is [open source](https://github.com/Shpigford/plylst), JAMM is meant to approach the same problem for individual users rather than as a service for all users.
